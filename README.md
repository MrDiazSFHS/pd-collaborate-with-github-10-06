# Teacher Professional Development Session 2: Collaborating with GitHub

## Assignment

### Task 1: Merge Conflicts
Let's create merge conflicts!

1. Click the `Fork` button in the top right corner to generate your own copy of this repository.
2. In your `locations.md` file, list where you are from (this can be where you live, where your school is located, your hometown, or where you'd rather be right now ðŸ˜„).
3. Commit your changes.
4. Click on your Pull Requests tab. Verify your Pull Request configuration and changes, then click `Create Pull Request`.
5. If you have a merge conflict, you'll need to resolve it before you can submit your pull request. The merge conflict will look like this:

```
<<<<<<< new branch
changes
=======
original
>>>>>>> original-branch
```

Delete the lines with <<<, >>>, and ===. Edit the changes so that the final result includes your city but doesn't remove anyone else's city.  
6. Once you have completed your pull request, wait for the facilitator to approve your changes and "pull" them into the original repository.

### Task 2: Code Review
If there is time, we'll practice code reviews.

1. The facilitator will add you as a collaborator on the original repository. You'll be able to merge your own pull requests, but only after someone else has reviewed your code!
2. Once the facilitator has added you as a collaborator, you'll receive an email to accept the invitation to the repository. You can also accept the invitation with this link: `https://github.com/arelia-classroom-demos/[insert name of repository here]/invitations`
3. Edit the `what-do-you-teach.md` file and commit your changes in a new branch.
4. Open a pull request to add your changes to the main branch (this may open automatically when you choose to commit to a new branch)
5. Add one of your classmates to review your changes in your pull request. Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise in your pull request.
